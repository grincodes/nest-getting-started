Asynchronus Providers
    sometimes we need the application start to be delayed until 
    an async task is completed

    you can achieve that with async providers and useFactory

    ```
        {
        provide: 'ASYNC_CONNECTION',
        useFactory: async () => {
            const connection = await createConnection(options);
            return connection;
        },
        }
    ```

    Injection#
    Asynchronous providers are injected to other components by their tokens, like any other provider. In the example above, you would use the construct @Inject('ASYNC_CONNECTION').
