Provider scope#
A provider can have any of the following scopes:

DEFAULT	A single instance of the provider is shared across the entire application. The instance lifetime is tied directly to the application lifecycle. Once the application has bootstrapped, all singleton providers have been instantiated. Singleton scope is used by default.

REQUEST	A new instance of the provider is created exclusively for each incoming request. The instance is garbage-collected after the request has completed processing.

TRANSIENT	Transient providers are not shared across consumers. Each consumer that injects a transient provider will receive a new, dedicated instance.

Usage#
Specify injection scope by passing the scope property to the @Injectable() decorator options object:


import { Injectable, Scope } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class CatsService {}
Similarly, for custom providers, set the scope property in the long-hand form for a provider registration:


{
  provide: 'CACHE_MANAGER',
  useClass: CacheManager,
  scope: Scope.TRANSIENT,
}

There is COntroller Scope as well
