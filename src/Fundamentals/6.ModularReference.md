Modular Reference
ModuleRef can is used to get acces to all instance to providers in a module

Nest provides the ModuleRef class to navigate the internal list of providers and obtain a reference to any provider using its injection token as a lookup key. The ModuleRef class also provides a way to dynamically instantiate both static and scoped providers. ModuleRef can be injected into a class in the normal way:


@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  private service: Service;
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  onModuleInit() {
    this.service = this.moduleRef.get(Service, { strict: false });
  }
}
