Lazy loading 
by default nest uses eager loading which means as soon aas the application loads 
so do all modules whether or not they are immediatley necessary.
while this is fine for most applications , it usually becomes a bottleneck
for apps/workers running on serverless environment where startup latency
is crucial (lambda function has 6mins to run)

lazy loading is loading only application that are needed.
In addition, you could also load other modules asynchronously once the serverless function is "warm" to speed-up the bootstrap time for subsequent calls even further (deferred modules registration).

Getting started 
to load modules on demand inject LazyModuleLoader in the constructor
constructor(private lazyModuleLoader: LazyModuleLoader) {}
