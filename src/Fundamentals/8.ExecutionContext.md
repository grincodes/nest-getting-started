Execution context
they are utilties that provide information about the current context

We cover two such classes in this chapter: ArgumentsHost and ExecutionContext.

ArgumentsHost is used to retrieve arguments passed by handler
eg ExpressHttp has req,res while Graphql has [root,args,context,info]


Current application context#
When building generic guards, filters, and interceptors which are meant to run across multiple application contexts, we need a way to determine the type of application that our method is currently running in. Do this with the getType() method of ArgumentsHost:


if (host.getType() === 'http') {
  // do something that is only important in the context of regular HTTP requests (REST)
} else if (host.getType() === 'rpc') {
  // do something that is only important in the context of Microservice requests
} else if (host.getType<GqlContextType>() === 'graphql') {
  // do something that is only important in the context of GraphQL requests
}

ctx.getHandler() for controller
ctx.getClass() for class

Note dont use @SetMetaData directly on controllers to set meta data its not wxpressive and its not strongly typed use decorators instead

eg (role.decorator)
import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const Roles = (...roles: string[]) => SetMetadata('roles', roles);

eg (cat.controller)
@Post()
@Roles('admin')
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}

To access the route's role(s) (custom metadata), we'll use the Reflector helper class, which is provided out of the box by the framework and exposed from the @nestjs/core package. Reflector can be injected into a class in the normal way:

roles.guard.ts

@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard {
  constructor(private reflector: Reflector) {}
}
HINT
The Reflector class is imported from the @nestjs/core package.
Now, to read the handler metadata, use the get() method.


const roles = this.reflector.get<string[]>('roles', context.getHandler());
